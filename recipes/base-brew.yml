    nofile-limits: false # Whether to increase nofile limits (limits for number of open files) for Brew installations. When set to true, it increases the nofile limits to prevent certain “I/O heavy” Brew packages from failing due to “too many open files” error. However, it’s important to note that increasing nofile limits can have potential security implications for malicious applications which would try to abuse storage I/O. Defaults to false for security purposes. https://serverfault.com/questions/577437/what-is-the-impact-of-increasing-nofile-limits-in-etc-security-limits-conf
